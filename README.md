# Videobox

Videobox is a Python web app that lets you discover and download the latest TV series.

## Prerequisites

Videobox requires the Python 3 programming language to be installed on your machine. If you are not familiar with it please refer to the official Python's [download page][d] for more information. 

To check if you have Python installed type the following after in your terminal prompt (`$`):

```
$ python --version 
Python 3.9.6
```

Any Python version starting from 3.9 should run Videobox just fine. 

**Note**: currently Videobox requires an external BitTorrent client ([uTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com), [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com), etc.) to download video files.

## Installation

You can install Videobox along with the main Python installation of your machine or in so-called "virtual environment", which is the recommended approach, since its dependencies may clash with packages you have already installed. [Learn more about virtual environments][venv]. 

Install or update Videobox from [PyPI][2] via the Python `pip` utility. Again, type the following command in your terminal:

```
$ python -m pip install -U videobox
```

## Quick start

You use Videobox via its web interface. To access it, start the `videobox` command on the terminal and point the web browser to the given URL:

```
$ videobox
Videobox has started. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080 to use the web interface.
```

At startup Videobox updates its library and will attempt to do it again periodically.

Add `--help` to list all the available options:

```
$ videobox --help 
Usage: videobox [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --host TEXT     Hostname or IP address on which to listen. Default is
                  0.0.0.0, which means "all IP addresses on this host".
  --port INTEGER  TCP port on which to listen, default is 8080
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```

If your are interested in hacking the source code or contribute to the project see the [contributing document][contrib].

## Building the macOS app 

If you are on a Mac you can compile Videobox into a menu bar app. 

First, install the necessary dependencies with:

```
$ make install-package && make install-build-deps
```

Then build the app with:

```
$ make build-app
```

If everything went fine you will find the compiled app into the `dist` folder. The first time you run the app you will need to manually authorise it, please [follow these instructions][1].

The build app process has been tested macOS Mojave (Intel), Ventura (arm64), and Sonoma (arm64). 


## Roadmap

This is a rough plan of what I would like to implement in the upcoming releases:

* **0.8**: Support for "complete season" torrents.
* **0.9**: [libtorrent][l] integration.

## Motivation 

I've seen too many torrent web sites full of tracking scripts, pop-ups windows and crypto mining to remember. In the past years I've built a number of scripts to scrape such sites and now it's time to put all together in a coherent way.
