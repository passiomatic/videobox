# Videobox

Videobox is a Python web app that lets you discover and download the latest TV series.

![The Videobox home page](https://videobox.passiomatic.com/screenshot-0.6.jpg?1)

## Prerequisites

Videobox requires the Python 3 programming language to be installed on your machine. If you are not familiar with it please refer to the official Python's [download page][d] for more information. 

To check if you have Python installed type the following after in your terminal prompt (`$`):

```
$ python --version 
Python 3.9.6
```

Any Python version starting from 3.9 should run Videobox just fine. 

**Note**: currently Videobox requires an external BitTorrent client ([uTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com), [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com), etc.) to download video files.

## Installation

You can install Videobox along with the main Python installation of your machine or in so-called "virtual environment", which is the recommended approach, since its dependencies may clash with packages you have already installed. [Learn more about virtual environments here][venv]. 

You install Videobox from [PyPI][2] via the Python `pip` utility. Again, type the following command in your terminal:

```
$ python -m pip install videobox
```

The install procedure will also create a `videobox` command, available in your terminal. 

## Quick start

You use Videobox via its web interface. To access it you start the `videobox` command on the terminal and point your web browser to the given URL:

```
$ videobox
Server started. Point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8080 to use the web interface.
```

Once the page is loaded Videobox will ask you to update your library by clicking the update button ðŸ”„.

## Additional command-line options

Add `--help` to list all the available options:

```
$ videobox --help 
Usage: videobox [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --host TEXT     Hostname or IP address on which to listen, default is
                  0.0.0.0, which means "all IP addresses on this host".
  --port INTEGER  TCP port on which to listen, default is 8080
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```

## Building the macOS app 

If you are using a Mac you can compile Videobox into a menu bar app. 

First, install the necessary dependencies with:

```
$ make install-package && make install-build-deps
```

Then build the app with:

```
$ make build-app
```

If everything went fine, you will find the compiled app into the `dist` folder.

The first time you run the app you will need to manually authorise it, please [follow these instructions][1].

The build app process has been tested macOS Mojave (Intel), Ventura (arm64), and Sonoma (arm64). 


## Roadmap

This is a rough plan of what I would like to implement in the upcoming releases:

* **0.7**: Background sync.
* **0.8**: [libtorrent][l] integration.

## Motivation 

I've seen too many torrent web sites full of tracking scripts, pop-ups windows and crypto mining to remember. In the past years I've built a number of scripts to scrape such sites and now it's time to put all together in a coherent way.

If you would like to help with the Videobox development these are some essential steps to get you started.

### Setup the environment

Starting from the repo root you might want to create a new virtual environment, to avoid messing up pre-existing Pyhton packages on your machine: 

`$ make venv`

And activate it:

`$ source .venv/bin/activate`

Then, install all project dependencies into the virtual enviroment just created:

`$ make install-deps`

`npm`, the Node Package Manager, is required to install `parcel` to compile CSS styles and JavaScript code:

`$ npm ci && make build-assets`

Finally, run the web interface in debug mode:

`$ make`

When you are done you can exit the virtual enviroment with the `deactivate` command.

### Where to find Videobox data

The Videobox Python package stores local database and configuration settings in `~/.videobox`, while the macOS app uses `~/Library/Application Support/Videobox`. 

### Using the debugger with Visual Studio Code

Debug works just fine under Visual Studio Code once you pick the Python interpreter shown in the `.venv` folder created earlier. 

Place any breakpoint you need, hit F5 and editor will fire up the application.
