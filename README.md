# Videobox

Videobox is a Python program that lets you download latest TV series via a quick and simple command-line interface.

If you would like to hack the source code read the _Contributing_ section below.

## Install 

You can install Videobox from [PyPI][2] via the `pip` utility:

```
python -m pip install videobox
```

The install procedure will also create a `videobox` command, available in your terminal. For example, if you installed Python on macOS via [homebrew][3] the command will live in `/opt/homebrew/bin/videobox`.

Currently Videobox requires [aria2][1] to download contents. Please check aria2 documentation to install it on your machine.

## Quick guide

First, tell Videobox to update its local database:

```
$ videobox update
First run: import running series... 
(...)
```

**Note**: Videobox will auto-update itself if local database hasn't been refreshed for a while.

Find out what series are running:

```
$ videobox running -y7

## Contributing

Starting from the repo root you might want to create a new virtual environment, to avoid messing up pre-existing Pyhton packages on your machine: 

`make venv`

And activate it:

`source .venv/bin/activate`

Then, install all project dependencies into the virtual enviroment just created:

`make install-deps`

When you are done you can exit the virtual enviroment with the `deactivate` command.

### Using the debugger with Visual Studio Code

Debug works just fine under Visual Studio Code once you pick the Python interpreter shown in the `.venv` folder created earlier. 

Place any breakpoint you need, hit F5 and editor will fire up the application.
