Quick start:

`make install-deps`

Then run:

`make`

This will run the Python interpreter using `src/main.py` as application entry point. A few directiores will be created using the repo as root.

## Using the debugger 

Debug works just fine under Visual Studio Code. Place any breakpoint you need and hit F5. Editor will fire up `src/main.py` thus starting the application.
